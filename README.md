#K Means Clustering Algorithm
 

1.Specify number of clusters K.

2.Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.

3.Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.
